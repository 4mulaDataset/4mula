# 4MuLA: A Multitask, Multimodal, and Multilingual Dataset of Music Lyrics and Audio Features
The 4MuLA is a dataset built with music information extracted from the Brazilian portal [Vagalume](http://api.vagalume.com.br/docs/).
We are making available the small version of the dataset used for the experiments carried out on the paper along with a code snippet for reading.

This subset has a 5GB compress and 24GB after uncompressing and can be downloaded [here](https://mega.nz/file/nSAmTYhB#us-BHkE8FlFF5WABQs0IeGxNWC_B2aF9TvLuiXkbCgI).
The subset has the following attributes:
`musid_id, music_name, music_lang, lyric, art_name, art_id, main_genre, related_genre, related_art, related_music, art_rank, musicnn, melspectogram`

We also provide a file with only the metadata without any acoustic features, which can be downloaded [here](https://mega.nz/file/eWpyQKyT#7uTZQ9djcH3kF5zgHdVQ3nqGgp38TDWQpDur-guWZcE).

All dataset change will write in the file `CHANGELOG`. 

PS.: We will make the complete dataset and code available after the paper evaluation process, because the storage service may disclose the name of the paper's authors, which is denied in the blind review process.
